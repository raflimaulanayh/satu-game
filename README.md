## 🛠️ Technology Stack
This project is built using pure **Vanilla Web Technologies** for maximum performance and compatibility without heavy frameworks.

*   **HTML5:** Semantic structure and Canvas API for game rendering.
*   **CSS3:** Custom styling with CSS Variables, Flexbox/Grid, and Keyframe Animations for that "Neon" glow.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Core game logic, physics engines, collision detection, and audio synthesis.
*   **Web Audio API:** Real-time sound generation for sound effects and dynamic background music (no external MP3s needed!).

## 🚀 How to Run
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/raflimaulanayh/satu-game.git
    ```
2.  **Open locally:**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your favorite modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).
3.  **No Server Required:**
    Since the games use local assets and vanilla JS, they run directly from the file system. However, for the best experience (especially for Audio API policies), running a local server (like Live Server in VS Code) is recommended.

## 🎨 Design Philosophy
*   **Aesthetic:** Dark mode default, high contrast neon colors (Cyan `#0ff`, Magenta `#f0f`, Yellow `#ff0`), and glassmorphism UI elements.
*   **User Experience:** "Mobile-First" responsive design ensure games are playable on both desktop and touch devices.
*   **Audio:** Custom-built synthesizer engine in JS to create retro-futuristic soundscapes that adapt to gameplay.

## 👥 Credits
*   **Developed by:** Rafli Maulana & Antigravity (AI Assistant)
*   **Concept:** Satu University Student Engagement Initiative
